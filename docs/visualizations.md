# Visualizations
<span style="color:black"> The DSEO consists of six dimensions with hierarchical terms. 
Each dimension serves to answer a specific question about a data science learning resource.</span>

<span style="color:black">In the original design of the DSEO, every term was an instance of a
[SKOS](https://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/) concept, and all concept instances were connected 
with the broaderTransitive property. However, for the purposes of browsing on BioPortal, we created 
a version of DSEO that has a class/subclass structure. This is seen in the ttl file found
on [Github](https://github.com/bioint/DSEO) and [BioPortal](https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/DSEO).</span>

<span style="color:black">In the visualizations below, each oval is a concept, 
and each edge is labeled with the original SKOS property. Regarding the color of the edges, 
magenta edges indicate that 
the broader node/concept can be used to tag resources, and black edges indicate that the 
broader node/concept should not be used to tag resources. This color coding thus exists to 
show which dimension names can and cannot be used as a tag.</span>

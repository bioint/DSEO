## The Data Science Education Ontology (DSEO) is a collection of concepts that aims to capture learning needs in data science. 

#### It was designed with a data science practicioner's workflow in mind.

See an example of how DSEO can be used for facets in search and filtering [HERE](https://bigdatau.ini.usc.edu/search?query=machine+learning).

## Background
The DSEO was designed as part of the work to develop the 
TCC's [Online Data Science Education Platform](https://bigdatau.ini.usc.edu/)
(NIH Grant #1U24ES026465-03). The platform collects and organizes online data science 
training resources and materials and provides an interface for learners to search, 
explore, recommend, and collect resources they find valuable. Overall, the platform
aims to teach data science while leveraging techniques from data science.

Specifically, the DSEO is part of the Educational Resource Discovery Index, [ERuDIte](https://bigdatau.ini.usc.edu/about_erudite), 
and it serves to provide additional descriptors to learning resource metadata.

The Data Science Education Ontology is a collection of concepts that aims to capture learning needs in data science.

## docs
This directory contains documentation posted on [https://bioint.github.io/DSEO/](https://bioint.github.io/DSEO/).

## ontology_files
In this directory, we provide the .ttl file for DSEO.
Look for the suffix *-current.ttl* for the most recent version of the ontology. 
The current version aligns with v1.0 on [BioPortal](https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/DSEO).
The directory also contains source files for graphViz visualizations of the DSEO.

## Mapping the DSEO to other ontologies
We use SKOS mapping properties [https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-reference/#mapping](https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-reference/#mapping)
to map DSEO concepts to Wikipedia/DBpedia and EDAM concepts.
